Productivity Estimations of Bulldozers Using Machine Learning Approaches
Overview
This repository contains the code, presentations, and datasets used in the research article titled "Multiple Linear Regression & Random Forest Approach for Productivity Estimations of Bulldozers." The article explores 15 different machine learning model-dataset combinations for estimating bulldozer productivity. The models used include:

Multiple Linear Regression
Random Forest
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Elastic Net
This repository also includes case study presentations from different phases of the analysis, as well as final results documentation.
